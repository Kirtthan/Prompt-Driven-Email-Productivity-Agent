I've reviewed it with the engineering team and we have some concerns about the timeline for the AI features.\n\nSpecifically:\n- The natural language processing module seems ambitious for a 6-week sprint\n- We'll need at least 2 weeks for security audits before launch\n- The mobile app integration should probably be pushed to Q1 2024\n\nCan we schedule a call this week to discuss? I'm free Tuesday afternoon or Thursday morning.\n\nBest,\nSarah Chen\nVP of Engineering, TechVision",
